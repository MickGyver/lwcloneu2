   <p>
	  NewLedTester is a simple tool for testing your LedWiz
	  devices.  It lets you check that your devices are connected
	  and recognized by Windows, and lets you operate the
	  output ports to test that the lights and other feedback
	  devices you've attached are working properly.
   </p>

   <p>
	  The main window shows a list of all of the attached
	  LedWiz devices.  If no devices are listed, check your
	  USB cabling to make sure everything's plugged in correctly,
	  then click the Refresh button to scan for devices again.
   </p>

   <p>
	  Each LedWiz has 32 output ports.  To test the attached
	  lights or other devices, click the port number you want
	  to test, then click the ON button to turn the port on.
	  You can use the slider to adjust the brightness, or you
	  can select one of the flash mode buttons below it.
   </p>

   <p>
	  You can select multiple ports and change all of their
	  settings at once.  When more than one port is selected,
	  changes to the On/Off state, brightness level, and flash
	  pattern will be applied to all selected ports.
   </p>

   <p>
	  To select a range of ports, click on the first port,
	  then hold down the Shift key while clicking on the second
	  port.  All of the ports between the two will be selected.
   </p>

   <p>
	  You can also select ports individually by holding down
	  the Ctrl key as you click on them.  When the Ctrl key
	  is down, each port you click on will be individually
	  selected or deselected.
